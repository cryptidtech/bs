# BetterSign Wallets

Some reference implementations of wallets for the BetterSign protocol.

### In-Memory Wallet

This is a simple in-memory wallet implementation that can be used for testing purposes. It allows you to create, sign, and verify transactions without the need for a persistent storage.

### Argon2 Wallet 

This wallet implementation uses Argon2 for key derivation and storage. It is designed to be secure and resistant to brute-force attacks. The wallet can store multiple keys and allows you to derive keys from a master key using a passphrase.
